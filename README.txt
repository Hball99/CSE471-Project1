I had issues with dots and commas in the Score file. The score file that you provided used dots for floating point numbers, like 1.5. 
When I compiled the program, that didn't work. As soon as I changed all dots to commas, like 1,5 , everything worked perfectly fine.
I don't know if the reason for that is my program or the computer the program is compiled on...
So if there are any problems with the program, try changing . to , and vice versa
